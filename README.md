## 👋 Hello, Visitor!

Welcome to my **C++ Practice Repository** — a personal space where I sharpen my problem-solving and programming skills using **C++**.  
This repository showcases my journey through **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)** concepts.

---

## 🚀 About This Repository

This repository contains:
- 🧩 Implementations of **core DSA topics** – arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, sorting, and searching  
- 🏗️ **OOPs concepts in action** – classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction, and more  
- 💡 **Practice problems** inspired by *LeetCode*, *CodeChef*, and *GeeksforGeeks*  
- ⚡ Small **C++ projects** and experiments that strengthen real-world logic and design skills

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language:** C++  
- **IDE/Editor:** Visual Studio Code / Code::Blocks  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## 📚 Learning Goals

- Master **fundamental algorithms** and data structures  
- Strengthen understanding of **C++ OOPs principles**  
- Improve **code readability, modularity, and efficiency**  
- Prepare for **technical interviews and competitive programming**

---

## 🧩 Future Plans

- 🧪 Add unit tests for DSA programs  
- 🎨 Include interactive visual explanations  
- 💻 Create a collection of advanced problems (Dynamic Programming, Backtracking, etc.)  
- 📊 Add performance analysis for key algorithms
