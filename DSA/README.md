# Data Structures & Algorithms in C++

This folder contains my C++ implementations of core **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**.  
Each program is written for learning, experimentation, and strengthening problem-solving skills.

  - Insert at beginning
  - Insert at position
  - Insert at end
  - Delete from beginning
  - Delete from end
  - Display / Traverse

  - Insert
  - Delete
  - Display
- **[Circular Linked List](./Linked%20List/Circular)**
  - Insert
  - Delete
  - Display

---

### 🔹 Stack

- **[Stack](./Stack)**
  - Push
  - Pop
  - Peek
  - Display

---

### 🔹 Queue

- **[Simple Queue](./Queue)**
  - Enqueue
  - Dequeue
  - Display
- **[Double Ended Queue (Deque)](./Queue/Double%20Ended%20Queue)**
  - Insert at front
  - Insert at rear
  - Delete from front

  - Display

---

### 🔹 Searching Algorithms

- **[Fibonacci Search](./Searches)**
- **[Sentinel Search](./Searches)**

---

### 🔹 Sorting Algorithms

- **[Bubble Sort](./Sorts)**
- **[Insertion Sort](./Sorts)**
- **[Selection Sort](./Sorts)**
- **[Quick Sort](./Sorts)**
- **[Merge Sort](./Sorts)**

---

### 🔹 Hash Table

- **[Hash Table](./Hash%20Table)**
  - Hash function implementation
  - Insert key-value pairs
  - Search by key

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals

- Understand and implement core DSA concepts from scratch
- Strengthen logic building and problem-solving skills
- Prepare for technical interviews and competitive programming
- Practice clean, modular, and readable C++ code

---

## ✅ Future Plans

- Add more searching and sorting algorithms
- Implement trees (BST, AVL, Binary Heap)
- Implement graphs (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, etc.)
- Add time and space complexity explanations
